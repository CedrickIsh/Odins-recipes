# Odin Recipes

This is a basic HTML project for The Odin Project. It will demonstrate my ability to create structured web pages using:
- HTML for content structuring
- CSS for styling (optional)
- Git and GitHub for version control

This project will help reinforce my knowledge of repositories, commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Using Git commands for cloning, committing, and pushing
- Writing and structuring HTML pages
